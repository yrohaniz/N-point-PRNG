# N-point-PRNG
This code simulates a random variable that assumes a number of values with given probabilities.
This program takes as its input the values of a random variable e.g. X, and also the probability 
for each of those values and gives as its output a random sample generated for this specific random variable. 
The sample population number and the number of possible values must be provided at the outset. 
In the process of generating the random sample, the uniform pseudo random number generator is used as well.
